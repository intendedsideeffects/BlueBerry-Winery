This analysis explores a Vinho Verde wine dataset, examining how different physicochemical properties, such as acidity and alcohol content, relate to the wine's quality. By using machine learning techniques, we aim to predict the quality of Vinho Verde wine based on these key attributes. The presentation is designed for a non-technical audience.

This is my first Data Science project at Code Academy Berlin.
